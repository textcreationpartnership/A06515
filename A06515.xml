            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not vnknowen to all men (good chryſten reader) but that the true &amp; ſyncere teachers of the infallyble truthe of our ſauyour Ieſu Chryſt, ben falſely defamed vnto the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned people, &amp; theyr good name defaced to the, no lytell hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and reproche of the ſame truth / in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they (as they be borne in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vniuſtly) ſhulde in theyr wrytynges and ſermons, allure and withdrawe the forſayd rude people from penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer, from faſtyng, from watchynge, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paynes, from labours / &amp; fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from all good workꝭ. But what they ben and theyr workes alſo whiche reproue, ſclaunder, calumpnyate, and falſely impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the pure, ſyncere, and true worde of god pronounced by the mouthes of thoſe his good and

God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſte good and almyghtye of his excedynge and bountefull mercy and grace, to declare and ſet forth his infinyte goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes his electe, moſte welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued and faythful ſeruauntes / that they to theyr great conforte and conſolacyon, may be proued innocent of this moſt vntrue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſacyon wrongfully layde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr charge / and chiefely to the garnyſſhynge and deckynge

And thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes alſo done at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the blode, paſſyon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcyon, and ſatyſfaccyon of

his moſte dere and welbeloued ſone Ieſu Chryſt / in whome, by whome, and for whoſe ſake thou arte thus entyerly loued, fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and accepted. As wytneſſed our father of heuen hym ſelfe at the baptyſme of our ſauyour Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſu Chriſte, ſayenge. This is my welbeloued ſone, in whom or for whoſe ſake I am well pleaſed, that is to ſay, appeaſed and ſwa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged of my wrathe, immedyately here hym, that is to ſaye, beleue, truſte hym, ſtycke &amp; cleaue harde to hym by faythe. For it is he for whom I delyte in you, loue you, fauour you, petye you, &amp; accepte bothe you and your dedes. This is the fountayne, out of the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all the workes of a chryſten man oughte to procede / ſo that what ſoeuer buddeth out of the tre of this fayth, is accepted and
<pb facs="tcp:10224:4"/>
pleaſaunte before god / and els it is but ſynne and not accepted. As ſaynte Paule wryteth in the xiiii. chapytre to the Romaynes / what ſoeuer (ſayth he) is not of faythe is ſynne. And in the .xi. chapytre to the Hebrues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faythe it is impoſſyble for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to pleaſe god. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why is this, albeit thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe neuer ſo moche in almes / faſt neuer ſo moch, paye neuer ſo moch, watche neuer ſo moch / yea albeit thou haddeſt done as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good dedes as all the worlde. Yet yf thou haue not the faythe before reherſyd / that god for the blode of his ſone doth accept the &amp; thy workes / loue the, fauoure the, petye the / yea and that enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly and as his owne ſon &amp; heyre by adopcyon, all that euer thou doſte can not pleaſe god / but is
<pb facs="tcp:10224:5"/>
abomynable ſynne and dyſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyth hym vtterly. For howe is it poſſyble that thou ſhuldeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe hym, whan thou art but a Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>das vnto hym &amp; doſte beare two faces in one hoode / doynge one and thynkynge another. In thy dedes thou woldeſte ſeme to be his ſeruaunte, &amp; in thy hert thou doſt neyther loue hym, nor truſte that he loueth the. And albeit he hathe made neuer ſo many and great ꝓmyſes of ſaluacyon, mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye, loue, pety, and fauour, in the blod of his ſone to al that repent &amp; doubt not therof / but aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſte vnto it, yet thou (what ſoeuer thou arte that haſte not this fayth) lyke an hethen houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and an vnfaythfaull myſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, by thy infydelyte and falſe herte doſt make no better of hym but a lyer, and falſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe
<pb facs="tcp:10224:5"/>
/ a tyraunte, and a butchers curre delytyng in blode, and ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther doſte thou loue hym, truſte hym, nor fauour hym. For howe ſhuldeſt thou loue hym, whan thou acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteſt no better of hym than I haue ſayde. And agayne howe is it poſſyble that he ſhuld loue the, fauoure the, petye the, accepte other the or thy workes, ſeynge thou doſte fyrſte abiecte hym by thy ſynful dyſpayre and incredulytie. Yea what worldlye prince wold kepe ſuch a wretche in his houſe yf he knewe hym / howe moche leſſe than wolde he loue hym, fauoure hym, accepte hym, or any of his ſeruyce. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynſte ſuche workes it is that the true and faythfull mynyſters of Chryſtes worde haue foughten, as done in moſt falſe hypocryſye and deuelyſſhe deſpayre, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:10224:6"/>
otherwyſe they haue &amp; do hyghe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly prayſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende, as whan they be done in true faythe and loue towarde god &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes, as thou ſhalte ſe and fynde in this moſte goodly and excellente volume of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes / whiche (I beſeche god ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to fauour me) yf any of thoſe vntrue men / I wyll not ſaye, falſe deceyuers, dyd euer wryte to teach any thyng halfe ſo good in theyr lyues. But it is an olde prouerbe that a good thyng wyl prayſe it ſelfe / wherfore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte it vnto thyne owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment (good reader) to prayſe it, euer as thou ſhalte fynde cauſe / So bolde I am of the goodnes therof.

to the vttermoſt, (as the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the is) then I beſeche the (moſte gentyll and indyfferent reader) to take &amp; admytte all falſe backe byters &amp; ſclaunderers of goddes true mynyſters euermore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as they be, &amp; not to thynke the contrary, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as they moſt deadely belye thoſe good men in this behalfe / ſo they do alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges, as I truſte in god it ſhall more playnly appere / bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the to the (gentyll reader) &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to all the worlde in tyme com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myng.
